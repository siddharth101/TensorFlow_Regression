In this project, we employ TensorFlow to build a regression model for
prediction of noise Amplitude from Signal to Noise ratio and Frequency.
First we do some Data Exploration and Data Cleaning, then build our model and
finally use it for prediction.
The jupyter notebook Amplitude_SNR_Regression contains the project details.
